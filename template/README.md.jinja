## Developer Container

This repository includes a developer container configuration for Visual Studio Code. This allows you to run the Generic IOC locally and debug it. See https://epics-containers.github.io/main/tutorials/dev_container.html.

## Channel Access

The developer container exposes channel access ports on the loopback interface. If you have channel access clients running on the host machine, you can connect to the IOC by setting the `EPICS_CA_ADDR_LIST` environment variable as follows:

```bash
export EPICS_CA_ADDR_LIST=127.0.0.1
caget IOCNAME:PVNAME
```
